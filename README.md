Chess Game Implementation
ChessBoard Class:
Fields:
Two-dimensional array (8x8) to represent the chessboard cells.
Constructor:
Initializes the initial arrangement of pieces on the chessboard.
Method movePiece:
Moves a piece from one cell to another.
Checks the validity of the move.
Method isMoveValid:
Checks the correctness of the move considering the rules of each piece.
Methods for checking the game situation:
isCheck
isCheckmate
isStalemate
Method displayBoard:
Displays the current position on the chessboard in text form.
Additional methods for other game actions:
Capture a piece
Pawn promotion
Castling
Piece Classes:
Abstract Class Piece:
Base class for all chess pieces.
Fields:
Piece type
Color
Current position
Methods:
isValidMove in ChessBoard and Piece differs in the context in which these methods are called and what they do.
isValidMove in ChessBoard:
Checks the validity of a move on the chessboard.
Analyzes the move the player wants to make and checks if it's valid within the rules of the game and the specific board situation.
isValidMove in Piece:
Belongs to a specific chess piece (Pawn, Knight, Bishop, etc.) and determines if the move is valid for that piece based on its own movement rules.
Checks if the given move adheres to the movement rules of a specific piece, ignoring other pieces and game rules.
Methods to determine possible moves:
getAvailableMoves
Methods for specific actions:
isEnPassant: Determines if en passant capture occurred.
isCastling: Checks if castling occurred.
isPromotion: Determines if pawn promotion occurred.
Interaction Between Classes:
Creation and management of piece objects on the board through the ChessBoard class.
Utilization of methods from the Piece class to check move correctness and perform specific actions.
Testing:
Creation of test scenarios to verify the functionality of methods and classes.
Ensuring that all piece moves comply with the rules of chess.
Running the Chess Game:
To run a chess game from the main method of your application, you need to:

Create an object of a class implementing the chessboard.
Initialize the initial arrangement of pieces on the board.
Have a loop that manages the game moves (until the game ends).
Within the loop, handle user input (e.g., input starting and ending positions of pieces for a move).
After input, check if the move is valid on the current board.
If the move is valid, update the board state; otherwise, request re-entry of the move.
After each move, check end game conditions (e.g., check, checkmate, or stalemate).
Display the game completion message and exit the loop if necessary.
This is a basic structure, and implementation details may depend on the representation of the game and the logic of move handling.
